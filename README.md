# Popsa iOS Engineer Assessment
Photo Gallery app written in SwiftUI. 

Utilises `PhotoKit` to gain access to the userâ€™s photo library and fetch photos that are going to be shown in the app. Upon selecting an image, uses the `Vision` framework to analyse attention-based saliency for the image and use the bounding box returned to draw a red rectangle around the salient portion of the image.
